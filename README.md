# Vision
# 1.	Aim of the project is to make Mutual Fund Investing easy.
* The app will allow users to buy a mutual fund, view existing investments and sell the investment.
* The app will need 3 Main Screens
  - Discover
User will browse through a List of Mutual Funds. There will be a Tile Component for holding the information about a Mutual Fund like Fund Name, Fund House, Performance and Risk Factors. The screen will show top 10 Funds based on highest Performance and lowest Risk Rating. To see more funds, user can use the Search Bar at the top to look for any Fund in Canada. User will place a Buy Order from this screen.
  - Holdings
This will show the Funds user has already invested in.  There will be a Tile Component for showing the information like Fund Name, Fund Symbol, Amount Invested, Profit Percentage and Current Value of the Fund. User can search through the Holdings by Fund Name using the Search Bar at the top. User will be able to place a Sell or Buy Order for the held fund from this screen.
  - Orders
All the Buy and Sell type of Order will show up here. User will be redirected to this screen from Discover or Holdings screen after placing a Buy or a Sell Order. User can search through the Orders by Fund Name using the Search Bar at the top.  Each order will have a Tile Component holding the information like Order Type (Buy/Sell), Amount ($), Fund Name, Timestamp of when the Order was placed, Order Status (Processing/Complete/Failed) and Order ID (from Firebase). Orders are sorted from Latest to Oldest.
* The types of data needed: -
  - List of Mutual Funds: Third party API twelvedata.com
  - Holdings: Firebase Realtime Database
  - Orders: Firebase Realtime Database
